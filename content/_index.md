Hi! I'm Charles. I studied software engineering at the University of Waterloo and now work in New York[^covid]. You can email me at [charles@zinn.io][email].

I very occasionally write stuff on my [blog].

[^covid]: By "in New York" I currently mean "in my bedroom in my apartment in New Jersey, for a company based in New York".
