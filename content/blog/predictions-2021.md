title: Predictions for 2021
date: "2021-01-11"
---

Making predictions for the year seems like a good beginning-of-the-year tradition, so I'm trying it out. My evaluation criterion for these predictions will be their [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score), where I interpret the score roughly as follows:

- > 0.25: Bad (worse than predicting 50% for everything)
- 0.20-0.25: Okay
- 0.15-0.20: Good
- < 0.15: Excellent! (my expected score if all these predictions are perfectly calibrated is about 0.17)

# COVID-19

- The new COVID strain causes a noticeable rise in cases in the US[^strain]: 85%
- More than 3 million global COVID deaths: 75%
- More than 10 million global COVID deaths: 15%

  - ...by the end of the year: 95%
